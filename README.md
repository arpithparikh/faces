# faces
A human face recognition service built with Serverless framework using Twilio and Amazon Rekognition.

This project provides an overview of ‘serverless’ computing and drills the concept down by building a compelling example of ‘Shazam for Celebrities’ dubbed 'faces' using the Serverless Framework. Per Gartner, by 2022 most cloud architectures will evolve to a fundamentally serverless model rendering the cloud platform architectures dominating in 2017 as legacy architectures. 

Serverless architecture reflects the core-promise of cloud-computing by offering agility and capability on demand at a value price. It will be at your best interest to understand this technology, the evolving eco-system and how to harness it as it provides high productivity at low cost.

# Audience
You are a Developer or Solutions Architect wanting to learn the Serverless Framework and how to use it for developing your own auto-scaling, pay-per-execution, event-driven applications. You want to build applications that matters to business instead of spending time configuring, deploying and maintaining infrastructure. The boost in efficiency that the Serverless architecture promises is very compelling for you to ignore.
